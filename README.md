# Walmart Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This project performs advanced SQL analytics on a Walmart retail dataset to uncover actionable insights for business optimization. The analysis focuses on identifying product bundling patterns, revenue contribution by states, and customer purchasing behaviors to support strategic decisions in cross-selling, store layout design, and targeted marketing.

## Objectives

- Identify high-performing product categories based on revenue.
- Understand regional contributions to overall sales.
- Detect frequently reordered items for loyalty-focused promotions.
- Recommend data-driven strategies for enhancing in-store and online sales.

## Business Impact

**Cross-Selling Opportunities**  
Identified commonly bundled products, allowing the business to promote these items together online and improve shelf adjacency in physical stores.

**Customer Loyalty Insights**  
Frequent reorders of specific items inform loyalty program strategies and inventory prioritization.

**Geographic Strategy**  
High-revenue states like California can be targeted for pilot programs, while underperforming regions may benefit from localized marketing or pricing changes.
